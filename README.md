# Conventional-Optimization-Techniques

This repository contains the basic implementation of some of the conventional tools for opeimization.
Presently, the following algorithms have been uploaded:
1. Random Walk Algorithm              --solve for minimization for the function 4x^(2)+y^(2)-3xy+6x+12y
