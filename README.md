# Conventional-Optimization-Techniques

This repository contains the basic implementation of some of the conventional tools for opeimization.
Presently, the following algorithms have been uploaded:
1. Random Walk Algorithm              --solve for minimization of the optimization function f(x,y)= 4x^(2)+y^(2)-3xy+6x+12y
2. Exhaustive Search Algorithm        --solve minimization for the optimization function f(x)= (-64/x^2)+x
